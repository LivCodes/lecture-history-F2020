## Why Data Structures are useful
* Why are arrays useful? - organize data (given a specific order)
* Why are objects useful? - organize data as properties (key/value pairs)


### What are some disadvantages of arrays based on how they are stored in memory?
- Array will be slow when....
- search 
- inserting to an array (re-index)
- IF we have to reindex a lot of elements

### Can we create custom data structures (classes) that are "better" than arrays?
* (Singly) Linked Lists
* Queues 
* Stacks
* Trees 
* Graphs


### Why the hell would we build/use these data structures?
* Trade-offs!
* Even though creating these classes will take up more space, it may lead to faster run time?


### Node
* The building block of data structures

# Performance / Run Time
Inserting into an array is Linear runtime
Linked List/nodes inserting into an array is constant time (if you have access to the nodes)
