# What does this next "semester look like"


# Intro to Algorithms and why they matter

### Pre-Lecture Activity
Solve [this problem](https://gist.github.com/thuyanduong/24fea0813de4181e8f543c46b62e7b4d)



## Algorithm Definition

The algorithm to get ready for bed is:
1. Change into my PJ clothes
2. Brush my teeth
3. Go to my bed by lifting up the blanket and getting under the sheets

The algorithm to get ready for school (pre-COVID) is:
1. Wake up
2. Brush my teeth
3. Prep breakfast for me and my siblings
4. Leave the house and wait at my bus stop
5. Get on the bus and arrive at school 



## Let's solve the problem together
- There are multiple valid solutions


## But which solutions is "better"?
* Demo the different solutions


## Why does algorithm matter:
- **It matters in an interview**
- It matters on the job _if_ your data set is large
