## Best Practicies

### White spacing is your friend
* Use tabs to indent each block of code 
* Use spaces to improve readability. 

### Naming Convention
* snake_case
* camelCase
* CAPSLOCK

### Mark Down
* Use `` to create an in-line code snippet
* Use ``` to create a block code snippet
* Preview in AWS and in Github



## Reading Error Messages
* In coding, it's called "throwing an error" [img](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/hot-potato-20892390.jpg)
* Interpretting errors - Read the error message AND the line number;

#### ReferenceError
Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when de-referencing an invalid reference.
* Scoping problems

#### SyntaxError
Creates an instance representing a syntax error.
* Structural Problems
* Redeclaring something you can't redeclare

#### TypeError
Creates an instance representing an error that occurs when a variable or parameter is not of a valid type.
* Invoking something that is not a function 
* Reassigning something you can't reassign



## Debugging with console.logs
* Why is it called a 'bug'?
* Reading error message AND the line it's on! 
* What if there is no error message (silent failure)
  * Check your assumptions
