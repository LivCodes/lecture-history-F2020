# Lecture: Functions 
* Why are functions important?

## Mental Model: How would you explain what it is?
* Don't Repeat Yourself principle
* Function: you take some materials (input), do some process on it, and then you get something out of it

## Declaring functions in JavaScript
* keyword `function`
* name
* parameter list `()`
* function body `{}`

## Referencing a function vs calling (_invoking_) a function 
* How are functions like variables?
* How are they NOT like variables?
* Declaring vs referencing vs invoking a function
* Arguments vs parameters
* Control flow

The variable that's created 
* inside the parenthesis


Invoking a function means calling function
- invoke a function USING ( )

## Parts of a function
* Inputs
* What the function *does*
* The output, aka `return` value

## Rule of Replacement
```
let num = 6;
console.log(num + 2);
```

What happens if you have too many arguements?
Too few arguements?

## Function declaration vs Function expression,
Function expression, when you assign a function to a variable
* _hoisting_



## Functions are everywhere, built in JavaScript
