# OOJS Review

## Why use OO 
- easier for your object interact with each other
- each object has methods(actions/behavior) and property 
- memory 

## Four Pillars of OO JS
- Abstraction
    - hide away the implementation details  
- Encapsulation
    - bundle together data (properties) and actions (methods)
- Inheritance
    - don't repeat yourself. Use methods and properties from another class 
- Polymorphism (many - forms)
    -  An action or objets can take on many forms 
    -  pet.getAdopted()
    -  fido.getAdopted()
