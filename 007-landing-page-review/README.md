# Unit 1 - Lesson 1: Box Model and Layout Foundations
## Learning Lab - Landing Page Mockup

### Objective 
* On the job, a designer (or you!) might create a wireframe or a mockup of what your app or site should look like. It will then be your job to translate this into front end code.
* Your task for this lab is to recreate [this "Mockup"](https://www.figma.com/proto/Vm0MzNYpiV6ihbQHOb1SCH/9.12.19-Code-a-long-1?scaling=min-zoom&node-id=1%3A3) for a journal/blog webpage.
* Be sure to use _semantic HTML_ and all that you've learned about `display` properties to get as close to a _pixel perfect_ recreation of this mockup as possible!

### Directions
  1. If this is a *Practice Lab*, fork this repo and clone down the forked repo. **OR**
      * If this is a *Lab Assignment*, just clone this repo without forking it.
  2. Create your HTML and CSS files.
  3. Stage, commit, and push your changes regularly.
  4. If this is a *Practice Lab*, open a pull request into `The-Marcy-Lab-School:master` branch to submit. **OR**
      * If this is a *Lab Assignment*, copy the URL of this repo and submit it through Canvas. 

**Note**: If you would like to make changes to the text, color scheme, or photo on this page, feel free. I'm most concerned with how closely you can match the _layout_ of the mockup.
