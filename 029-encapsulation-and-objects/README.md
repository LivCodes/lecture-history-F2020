# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- We've been programming in a "function oriented way" (procedural)
- Why might be want to program in an object oriented way?

# Benefits
- Objects can hold data(s) like variables
- Couple data with methods!!!
- Mutable (dyanmic), can be changed over time

- Let's pretend we are building the next NBA 2K game

## Important OOP terms
- method is a function called off an object
- syntactic sugar, another way to write the same thing (more intuitive)
- getters and setters
- accessor properties are methods DISGUSED as data properties (logic and calculations)

### 4 Pillars of Object Oriented
- **Abstraction**
  - take away (hide) the implementation details
  - not be concerned with 'under the hood'
  - private vs public data
  - JS has public data only
  
- **Encapsultation**
  - package together (state) data properties and (behavior) methods

- Inheritence
- Polymorphism 

- `this` refers to the object that is calling the method


## Key Terms
* encapsulation
* state <-> data properties
* behavior <-> method
* accessor properties
* factory functions

## Essential Questions
* What is encapsulation? Why do we use it? How do objects enable it?
* How do objects encapsulate state? How do they encapsulate behavior?
* How do we create private data within JavaScript objects? What is the role of accessor properties?


* What are factory functions and why are they useful?
