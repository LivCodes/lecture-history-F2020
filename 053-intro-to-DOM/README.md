# Into to the DOM (Document Object Model)

## Unit 5: Dynamic Web pages
- Front End Web Dev
- We already learned how to make webpages, why even have this Unit 5?
- Why was JS built? To add behavior to a webpage!
  * HTML - skeleton/content 
  * CSS - looks/beauty/styling 
  * JS - behavior/brain  

## End Goal:
- Google Maps
- Less load time 
- Change parts of the webpage, but not all of it!

- Superior user experience!

## What is the Document Object Model?
- It's like HTML, but it's [alive](https://youtu.be/1qNeGSJaQ9Q?t=135)
- It's a JavaScript Object
  - It has properties and methods
- It's a TREE!

## Build our or Webpage
- Visualize the Tree!

## How do you write JS Code that interacts with the DOM?
- HTML 
- CSS
- With a `<script>` tag somewhere in the HTML page

## Chrome Developer tools
- Elements
- Sources
- Console

### Priorities
- Unit 5 Lessons and Lab Assignments 
- We will encounter Data Structures and Algorithms in code challenges throughout the year
