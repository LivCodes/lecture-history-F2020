# Objects

## What is an object and why are they useful?
* Another *data structure*!
* How are they different from arrays?

## Syntax to create an Object 
* `{ }`

## Parts of objects
* key       => must be a string (or symbol...)
* value     => can be anything
* property

## Getting values from an Object - Dot notation vs Bracket Notation
* `obj.key`        => key is a STRING
* `object[key]`    => key is a VARIABLE or EXPRESSION

Iterating through an objects
* How to get all the keys of an Objects as an Array 
    * Object.keys()   

* `for...in` loops
    * A more eloquent way to iterate over all Object keys
