# Objects
["Ann", 28, true] //"lists"
{age: 28, teacher: true, name: "Ann"} //organize, property 

## What is an object and why are they useful?
* Another *data structure*!
* How are they different from arrays?
["Ann", 28, true]
[28, true, "Ann"]

## Syntax to create an Object 
* `{ }`

## Parts of objects
* key       => must be a string (or symbol...)
* value     => can be anything
* property

## Getting values from an Object - Dot notation vs Bracket Notation
* `obj.key`        => key is a STRING
* `object[key]`    => key is a VARIABLE or EXPRESSION

# Iterating through an objects
* How to get all the keys of an Objects as an Array 
    * Object.keys()   

* `for...in` loops
    * A more eloquent way to iterate over all Object keys

# Enumerable properties of an Object





### Next Week...
* Functions as Object properties (methods)
* Arrays as Objects
* Copying objects, deep vs shallow copy 
* Iterating through an array of Objects
* Using objects as an alterative data structure to arrays
