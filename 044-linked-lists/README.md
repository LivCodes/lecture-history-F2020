# Linked Lists

## What is a Linked List?
- A linear data structure made up of nodes
- access to the "head" ONLY (abstract away the other nodes)
- NO random access

## Will I have to create Linked List class/methods?
- This IS LIKELY to be an interview question

## So let's build a Linked List 
* How are linked lists and arrays similar?
* How do linked lists and arrays differ in terms of performance??
 
adding to the end of a linked list is linear 
adding to the end of an array is constant 

adding to the start of a linked list in constant 
adding to the start of an array is linear time 

## What other methods could we create?
