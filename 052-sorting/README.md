# Sorting 

## Insertion Sort 
- Iterate through the list starting from the begining.
- Continue to compare the number with the value before it to INSERT it into place.
- As you iterate, your begining of the list, is always sorted
- O(n^2) run time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
- Good for lists that are nearly sorted.

## Bubble Sort 
- Iterate through the list two elements at a time.
- If the two elements need to be switched, do so.
- The large numbers will BUBBLE up at the end.
- O(n^2) run time complexity; O(1) space complexity.
- Good for lists that are nearly sorted.

## Merge Sort
- Recursive.
- Divide and Conquer technique, and MERGE back together.
- O(n log n) run time complexity; O(n) space complexity.
- Scales well; Good for large lists that are not almost sorted.

## Quick Sort 
- Recursive.
- "Pivot" technique.
- O(n log n) run time complexity; O(log n) space complexity.
- Scales well; Good for large lists that are not almost sorted.
- Best run time and space complexity, but algorithm is a pain.
