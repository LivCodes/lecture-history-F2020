- model open and closing pairs 
- stack of books 
- going back and forth in our browsing history
- Pez dispenser


## Stack methods
- size()
- isEmpty() // returns boolean
- push() // add an item to the "top" of the stack 
- pop() // remove an item from the "top" of the stack
- peek() // show us what's at the top 

## Are there different ways to implement a Stack?
- Yes, but arrays are simple AND fast!




## Bounded Stacks 
- A stack that has a maxSize.
- What is a stack overflow? 
- What is a stack underflow?

## What is THE Stack in JavaScript?
- demo different function calls
- What happens when there is an error in the code?
    - stack trace 
- What happens if we call too many functions?
