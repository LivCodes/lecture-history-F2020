- 

## Stack methods
- size()

## Bounded Stacks 
- A stack that has a maxSize.
- What is a stack overflow? 
- What is a stack underflow?

## What is THE Stack in JavaScript?
- demo different function calls
- What happens when there is an error in the code?
    - stack trace 
- What happens if we call too many functions?
