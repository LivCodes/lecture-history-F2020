# Ways to write functions
* function declaration
* function expression
* arrow functions

# First-class functions
* Be stored in a variable
* Hold their own properties and methods
* Be stored in some data structure
* Be passed as arguments to functions
* Be returned by functions

## Let's have some Among Us Fun(ctions)!

* orange is being chased
* orange called an emergency meeting
* orange was ejected
* cyan was killed
* green is swipping card 


# Higher-order functions
* Either has a function as a parameter, or returns a function
* Higher-order functions do work on other functions!

# Callback function
* a function that is passed as an argument and "called back" at a later point
