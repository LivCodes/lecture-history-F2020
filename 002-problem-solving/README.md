# Problem Solving (60 minutes)

# Objectives
FWBAT...
* Explain the PEDAC approach to solving coding problems.
* Analyze coding problems and break them down into sub-problems.
* Write pseudo-code for a variety of coding problems.
* Read error messages and debug why code is not working.
* Understand test cases and compared expected to actual results.

# Vocabulary
- Test cases
- Data Structures
- Algorithm
- Pseudo-code

# Why?
As developers, you will be asked to solve a plethora of coding problems/challenges, both during a job interview and on the job.
It's important to practice our problem solving abilities and our ability to communicate our thought process.

While there are many tried and proven systems of acing the coding interview, we will be using PEDAC.
- Understand the PROBLEM
- Use EXAMPLES and **_Test Cases_**
- Consider **_DATA STRUCTURES_**
- Design an ALGORITHM and write the **_pseudo-code_**
- Implement the CODE
