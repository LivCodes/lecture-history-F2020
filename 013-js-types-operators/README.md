# Unit 2 Lesson 1: Data Types, Values, and Operators


## Why?
* Data types are the building blocks of JavaScript. They are the data used to "build" a program, kind of like [legos blocks](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0JMrPWRQkTeg3jjO/giphy.gif) are used to build anything. 
* Operators are how you combine data to make other data. Using an **operator** on **data(s)** will result in a **value**.

## How to JavaScript?
* Multiple ways to "run" JavaScript
* We are going to run JavaScript through an `html` file. Preview the `index.html`, open in a new tab, and open the Chrome Developer tools (console).
* HTML, CSS, and JS are all "linked" together.

## What are the many data types in JavaScript, and how do they differ?
 * `typeof` operator
 
## Operators
 * unary operators (`++`, `--`, `typeof`)
 * binary operators (`+`, `*`, `&&`, `||`)

### Type Coercion
* Why does it happen?
* When does it happen?

### Logical Operators and Falsey Values
* `||`
* `&&`
* What does it mean to be falsey?

### Equality operator 
* `==` vs `===`

### Ternary Operator

`conditional` `?` `value_if_true` : `value_if_false`
