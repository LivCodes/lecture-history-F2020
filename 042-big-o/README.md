# Introduction to Big O, Run Time Complexity, Space Complexity

- Computer Science has a way to categorize algorithms base on _how they scale_ relative to their _input size_
- The context for "input size" may change from problem to problem

## Run Time Complexity
- How long will it take code to execute this algorithm

### O(1): Constant Run Time
- Math
- Figuring out if a number is even or odd
- Generating a random number
- Indexing an array

### O(n): Linear Run Time
- Iterating through a list
- A single loop 
 
# What is the Run Time of...
- adding a number to the end of an array
- adding a number to the begining of an array
- indexing an array


### O(log n): Logarithmic Run Time
- find something in a sorted list (Phone Book)


### O(n*log n): Log Linear Run Time
- Sorting

### O(n^2): Quadratic
- Comparing every element to every other element in an array
- Loop within a loop

### O(2^n): Exponential
- Cracking the code for a lock




## Space Complexity
- How much _additional_ space is needed execute this algorithm

### Constant Space 
- Primitive data types

### Linear Space 
- Creating new arrays or objects
