# Why JavaScript?

## Aren't HTML pages enough?
  * Maybe... But what makes a good website?
  * Your websites are great, but to really understand user experience, let's go back to the begining...
 
## Software development in the 90s

As an average-every-day-person:
  * You could use a website...
    * Webpages that may or may not load quickly
    * Images that may or may not load at all
    * Lag... so much lag...
  * OR, you could use a desktop application
    * CD ROMs
    * Load it into your computer, and BAM!
    * No lag once the program starts
    * You could INTERACT with the program!

**Desktop applications were a superior user experience!**

## So what does that mean for the Internet of the 90s
No one LIKED using the Internet, so it had to adapt to survive.
  
### Challenge:
  * Websites had HTML and CSS (content and styling). You could go from "page to page", but you couldn't program BEHAVIOR into the pages like you could a Desktop application.

### Solution:
  * Netscape's developer Brendan Eich created JavaScript so you could "program" a webpage.

### What can you do with JavaScript?
  * Build dope-ass web applications (Front End)
  * Interact with data and Databases (Back End)
  * Use it as a simple programming language to solve problems 

### How can we connect HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

## Tips for Unit 2 - JavaScript Foundations
 * For many fellows last year, mastery of this unit got them their jobs.
 * Most college-y unit of them all. 
 * Frame of Mind: Treat learning like a game; each function we have you write is a level for you to conquer and defeat!
